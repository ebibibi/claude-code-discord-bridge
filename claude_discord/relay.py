"""Thread-to-thread relay — one Claude session speaking to another.

Sessions can already see each other (``GET /api/sessions``) and read each
other's threads.  This is the write side: a session that finds a peer working
on the same task can say so, and ask it to stand down.

The dangerous part is not the delivery, it is the *loop*.  Two sessions that
answer each other burn tokens and interrupt each other indefinitely, and each
message can preempt a running turn.  ``RelayGuard`` is the brake: it bounds how
far a chain of relayed messages can travel (hops), how often a pair may talk
(cooldown), and how much one sender may emit (rate limit).  It is pure,
in-memory and clock-injected so the rules are testable without a bot.
